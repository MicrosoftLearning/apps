# Microsoft Learning AI Apps

This repository contains source code and published web apps for educational use. The apps are designed to support training modules on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com) and are <u>not</u> intended (or supported) for use in production solutions. They are not supported Microsoft services or products, and are provided as-is without warranty of any kind.

All of the apps are designed to run locally in-browser. No data is uploaded to Microsoft, though some apps make use of external web services such as Wikipedia to return query results based on user input. To run the apps successfully, you need a modern browser, such as Microsoft Edge. In some cases, the full app functionality is only available on computers that include a GPU (integrated or dedicated). When using Windows on ARM64 computers, you may need to enable WebGPU in your browser flag settings (for example at edge://flags or chrome://flags). The GPU-based apps are designed to use a "fallback" mode with some functionality restrictions when no GPU is available.
